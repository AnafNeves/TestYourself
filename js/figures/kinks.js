/* =========================================================================
   How kinky — what the Sexuality level (the `sex` block) feeds back: one
   dimension, kept that simple on purpose.

   The dimension is Kinkiness, vanilla to kinky: how many of the items in
   content/block_sex.js — a kink, or one side of one — turn somebody on,
   whether or not they have done it. It is drawn as the crowd it is read
   against, stood on end — a band for each number of them from none at the
   foot to all at the top (twenty-two items, so twenty-three bands), each
   as wide as the share of people turned on by that many and drawn both ways
   out of a spine, so the crowd is one shape, a violin, out of the norm's
   `distribution` — shaded from vanilla to kinky as far as the person
   reaches, their own band lit in gold and the rest dim beyond, so the shaded
   part of the crowd is the share the words under it give. The MINT's crowd
   card turned upright, so that kinkier is higher. The norm is a placeholder
   stretched from the Big Kink Survey's (the block file says how), so the
   standing is said against "people" like every other placeholder's, and the
   crowd is named again once the app has one of its own.

   Under the count, how many of those turn-ons have been lived out: the grid
   asks whether each was done beside whether it appeals, and the share acted
   on is the number people will want to share. It says nothing about which.

   NOTHING ON IT SAYS WHICH KINKS, and that is the rule to keep. A sentence
   naming the rarest kink that turned somebody on (the taboo reading, with how
   many people share it) was written and taken out, September 2026: it was
   the most engaging line on the level, and the one thing on it that gave an
   answer away — on a screen read over a shoulder, in a level's picture, and
   in whatever is later shared or compared. Counts and a standing can travel;
   a named kink cannot.
