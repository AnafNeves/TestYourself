"""Save a level's figure, drawn by the app itself at stand-in answers, as a PNG
for the preview card that sets it beside the level's name (kinks.png for
sexuality.html, wheel.png for archetypes.html).

A card's picture is either restated by hand (the opinions plane, a few dozen
lines) or, where the figure is too much drawing to copy, taken from the app:
the level's results are rendered through makeResults with a stand-in engine,
and the part wanted is turned into a picture by js/snapshot.js — the same
snapshot() that "Copy as image" uses, which writes every computed style onto
a copy, so the picture looks as the page does. The stand-in answers are in
FIGURES below, chosen to make a picture worth looking at; they are nobody's.

Run by hand when a figure changes (python assets/preview/still.py, or name
figures: python assets/preview/still.py kinks), then make.py for the JPEGs.
It wants the page served on port 8123 (the testyourself config in
.claude/launch.json) and Playwright with Edge, as assets/readme/make.py does.
