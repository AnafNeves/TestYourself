   Moving between the slides, and the few things on them that can be
   pressed: a row of the Content table, a card on the study slide, a level on
   its run, anything naming a slide to go to (`data-to`, the slide's id). A slide is a `<section class="slide">` in index.html; moving
   counts them and never looks at what is inside one, so adding a slide is
   writing another section and nothing here.

   The slide showing is in the address (`#2`), so a link holds its place and a
   reload comes back to it — which is the one thing a deck wants from a server
   and this way does not need one.
