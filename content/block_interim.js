// link on SONA brings it, so that link has to say `?pid=%SURVEY_CODE%` beside
// `&source=SONA&project=mint` — without it the code is one the app made, and
// SONA grants nothing for it. Offered only to a run whose link says
// `?source=SONA` (any case), under the debrief and over the choice to go on
// (`Briefing_Onward`).

    // THE INTERIM ==========================================================
    // The end of the main part of the study — the core, which the ethics
    // application asks of everybody — and the way into the rest, which it does
    // not. It is written on the timeline between the two forks as an
    // interlude (see content/timeline.js): it opens the place after the core,
    // whichever level the person then puts there, and it is none of that
    // level's, so nothing in it counts towards the level's ring, its
    // countdown or its quality control.
    //
    // Somebody who stops once the core is done has, by then, said how
    // seriously they took it and anything they wanted to say. These are the
    // two questions the closing asks at the very end, asked again here under
    // keys of their own, so that each stretch of the run has its own answer:
    // somebody tired by the last level may say so, and that should cast no
    // doubt on their core.
    //
    // Then one screen for the rest: the debrief, the SONA credit for a run
    // that came from SONA, and the choice to go on or stop.
    //
    // Every other briefing is written to hold wherever the timeline puts it.
    // These say where in the run they fall, since that is what they are for.
    //
    // The thank-you is the one briefing that is a reward rather than a pause
    // (`celebrate`): the end of the part of the study that is asked of
    // everybody, and for most people the end of the study.
