   content/block_sex.js — a level on sexuality. ASKED ONLY BY `?battery=all`:
   it is on the timeline, as a level of its own (`Sexuality`) in the second
   fork, but it is in NOT_YET_COVERED in content/timeline.js, so the `default`
   battery — what a link naming none asks — leaves it out. It is not in the
   ethics application, and no link a participant is sent may name `all`.
   Moving it into `default` takes THE BLOCKERS, below, first.

   The file is in three parts: what is asked (this header, then the block),
   then NOTES — the thinking so far, kept beside the block it is about rather
   than in a conversation nobody can find again — then SHELVED, the items
   written and taken out, kept whole so that any of them can come back.

   WHAT IS ASKED (September 2026), in order:

     Briefing_Sexuality  LOCKED IN. Why a test of the person asks about sex
                         at all: a large part of a life and a small part of
                         the science, too often studied as a problem.
     sexuality           LOCKED IN. Relationship status (added September
                         2026, what the rest of the level reads against);
                         orientation (and, after "Something
                         else", in their own words); the number of women and of
                         men somebody has had sex with, asked by the
                         orientation as a behavioural check on it; and
                         masculine-feminine on a slider. Scored nowhere.
     Briefing_Desire     ACTIVE. The SIS/SES-SF's own instructions: what
                         "aroused" means, and to answer a situation never
                         met as if it had been.
     sisses              ACTIVE (September 2026). Desire: the SIS/SES-SF's
                         fourteen items, the dual control model's accelerator
                         (Sexual Excitation) and two brakes (Inhibition:
                         Performance, Inhibition: Consequences), checked
                         against the chapter, with its published norms.
                         Read back as How hot is your volcano?
                         (js/figures/volcano.js), a PROTOTYPE (NOTES,
                         DESIRE).
     Briefing_Kinks      ACTIVE. What the list is, before its first item, so
                         that it does not come out of the blue.
     kinks               ACTIVE. Twenty-two items — fourteen kinks, eight of
                         them asked as their two sides — one screen each,
                         answered as one cell of a grid: does it turn you on
                         (It's not for me / I'm fine with it / It turns me
                         on) across,
                         and have you done it (Never / not yet, Once or twice,
                         Many times, Part of my sex life) down, with one more
                         column in front, "It disgusts me", for the recoil
                         "It's not for me" is too polite for (see THE KINKS).
                         Scored as how
                         many turn somebody on: Kinkiness, vanilla to kinky.
                         Everything else a cell says — done without wanting,
                         wanted and never done, which side — is in the words,
                         for the figure and the analysis.

   The level closes on one figure (js/figures/kinks.js): the crowd as a
   violin, stood on end, of how many of the items turn people on, with the
   person's band lit and where they stand among those people, and how many of
   their turn-ons they have lived out — and nothing that says which (a
   sentence naming the rarest was taken out, September 2026, as the one
   reading that gave an answer away; the figure's header says more). Everything on the level is
   `profile: false`. Why kinks at all, what else measures them, what was
   weighed and why this — under THE KINKS in NOTES.

   `liking` (Sexual Liking, erotophilia-erotophobia as the affect ten ordinary
   cues meet with) was asked here until September 2026 and is PARKED under
   SHELVED. The one PLACEHOLDER item that stood in for Desire (libido) went
   with the plane it drove.

   THE BLOCKERS, before `default` may ask it:

     1. IT CANNOT BE MADE OPTIONAL YET. A fork orders the levels in it but
        every one is walked in the end, so somebody who does not want to be
        asked about sex has no way past the level but closing the tab. It
        wants a way to decline a whole level, which the engine does not have.
     2. ARTICLE 9. Sex life and sexual orientation are special-category data
        under UK GDPR Article 9, like the opinions level's political opinions,
        and explicit items want an amendment (A5/A6). Anything whose extremes a
        committee would not pass — incest, animals, ages, gore — is out, and
        `askable` in data/norms/norms_bks.R marks which. Unwanted attention is
        asked, if at all, only as a consensual game: asked straight, its
        experience would be a question about assault.
     3. DECLINING AN ITEM. Solved (October 2026): "I'd rather not say" is a
        `declined` answer, which app.js leaves out of the dimension rather
        than holding it unfinished or counting it as anything. A dimension
        is scored on the items answered once `enough` of them are (two
        thirds, on both questionnaires here), and below that its figure is
        drawn blurred with a line saying the questions were not answered.
        Until then the kinks scored a skip as not a turn-on (`score: 0`), so
        somebody who declined all twenty-two was told they were more vanilla
        than 99% of people, which a pilot was; and one skip on the Desire
        items held the whole volcano back without a word. The file keeps the
        words, so an analysis can tell a skip from a no either way.
     4. WHETHER SOMEBODY'S OWN RESULTS MAY BE SHARED. Every level carries
        "Share these results", a link and an image; this one's carries a
        person's sex life to whoever it is sent to, and on from there.

// THE KINKS. Each item is one kink, or one side of one, answered as a cell
// of a grid (`type: "grid"`): across, whether it turns somebody on — It's not
// for me / I'm fine with it / It turns me on — and down, whether they have
// done it —
// Never / not yet, Once or twice, Many times, Part of my sex life. Two scales
// at one press, so that the cells a single line of steps cannot reach are
// answers: fine with it and done regularly (the accommodating partner, the
// commonest answer to some of these), turned on and never done (the
// fantasy), not for me and done (tried and disliked — or done for somebody
// else, which the analysis reads off the "many times" row of that column and
// nothing on screen names). Three lifetime rows and one present-tense one, so
// a habit given up is "many times".
//
// And a fourth column in front of them, "It disgusts me" (September 2026):
// the recoil that "It's not for me" is too polite to hold. Not for me is a
// preference
// and says nothing about how strongly; disgust is a reaction, and the one the
// notes kept wanting a measure of (THE LIKING CUES, and the TDDS shelved).
// Counted over the twenty-two it is a disgust score of its own, read at
// analysis time; it scores 0 towards Kinkiness like every cell off the
// "It turns me on" column. It has a cell in every row, though disgust at
// something that is "Part of my sex life" should be rare: rare enough to be a
// check on whether somebody is reading the table, and where it is not rare it
// is worth knowing about (done for a partner, or a kink that is part of its
// own appeal). "It disgusts me" rather than "Eww" or "filthy": plain, like
// "It turns me on" at the other end of the row, and "filthy" is praise to
// some of the people answering. All four headers are written as short
// sentences of about one length ("It's not for me", "It turns me on"), so
// that each wraps onto two lines in a narrow column and the header row is
// even.
//
// The cells are written out as options (`gridOf`), one a pair, each carrying
// the `across` and `down` value it stands at, so that the file, the codebook
// and test mode see an ordinary choice; only renderGrid() in app.js reads the
// table. A cell's text is its two headers, which is what `said()` saves
// ("It turns me on · Once or twice"). What is scored is the column alone
// (`score:`, read by counted() in app.js in place of the value): 1 for a
// turn-on and 0 otherwise, so the dimension's mean is the share of the items
// that turn somebody on and the figure draws it as a count. The row is in the
// words.
//
// "I'd rather not say" is a way out under the table, declined: left out of the
// count rather than counted as a no, so the share is of the kinks answered,
// while `enough` of them are (THE BLOCKERS, 3). It was scored 0 until October
// 2026, which read twenty-two skips as twenty-two kinks that turn nobody on.
// The file keeps the words, so a skip can be told from a no.

    // DESIRE: the SIS/SES-SF ================================================
    // The Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Excitation Scales – Short Form (Carpenter,
    // Janssen, Graham, Vorst & Wicherts, 2010, in Fisher, Davis, Yarber &
    // Davis, eds., Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures, 3rd ed., pp.
    // 236-239; on the shelf as literature/Carpenteretal2010SISSES-SF.pdf),
    // fourteen items of the SIS/SES's forty-five (Janssen, Vorst, Finn &
    // Bancroft, 2002), chosen as the ones measurement-invariant across women
    // and men: the dual control model's accelerator and its two brakes.
    // Excitation is how readily somebody is aroused (six items); Performance,
    // inhibition by distraction and the fear of losing arousal once it is
    // there (four); Consequences, inhibition by the risks of the situation —
    // being seen, being caught, an infection (four). The three are fairly
    // independent of one another, which is the model's point: a strong
    // accelerator says nothing about the brakes. What it adds to the kinks,
    // which cannot say it: whether somebody who scores kinky is somebody who
    // wants many things or somebody who wants a lot (NOTES, DESIRE).
    //
    // VERBATIM from the chapter's appendix but for the full stops, with TWO
    // ADAPTATIONS, so this is an adapted SIS/SES-SF and none of its items is
    // to be pooled with the published data as the same item.
    //
    // The first: four items (2, 6, 7 and 13) end on a negated outcome, "I am
    // unlikely to stay aroused", which on an agree-disagree scale leaves
    // disagreeing as a double negative to be worked out. They are reworded
    // to say the outcome, in the words the scale already uses for it (item
    // 5's "I will lose my sexual arousal", item 12's "I easily lose my
    // arousal"): same situation, same direction, agreeing is still more
    // inhibition, nothing reverses. The published wording is beside each.
    //
    // The second: items 5, 9 and 12 are printed in two versions, the men's
    // and the women's, divided by a slash ("lose my erection/my arousal"),
    // for the questionnaire to be given in one or the other by sex. Here
    // everybody is given the women's, which speaks of arousal and not of
    // erections: arousal covers an erection, and choosing a version by sex
    // would mean guessing somebody's body from `Demographics_Gender`, which
    // the level may not even have (`?only=sex`) and which does not say it.
    // So for women these three are the published items and for men a close
    // variant, and a man's Performance and Consequences scores are not
    // strictly the SIS/SES-SF's; the men's words are beside each. Item 9 is
    // also the instrument's weakest (Velten et al., 2018, drop it for fit)
    // and asks about intercourse, which not everybody's sex is; kept, so the
    // scale is the published one, and the first to adapt if it misfits.
    //
    // The published scale runs 1 "Strongly agree" to 4 "Strongly disagree"
    // and is recoded before scoring so that high is more excitation or more
    // inhibition; here it runs disagree to agree, left to right as every
    // other scale in the run does, so the values are the recoded ones and
    // nothing reverses. The published instructions (the chapter's appendix)
    // are carried by `Briefing_Desire`, below: what "aroused" means, and that
    // a statement that does not apply is answered as if it did — which the
    // lead-in over each item says again, since several are situations
    // somebody may never have been in (sex outdoors, a sexy voice on the
    // telephone). The chapter prefers an incomplete scale discarded to one
    // filled in with means. The feedback is more lenient: "I'd rather not
    // say" is declined, and a subscale is read off the items answered while
    // two thirds of it are (`enough`: three of the four-item brakes, four of
    // the six-item accelerator), the volcano being drawn blurred with a line
    // saying so below that (THE BLOCKERS, 3). An analysis keeping to the
    // chapter's rule reads the skips in the file.
    //
    // Shuffled: nothing in its validation fixes an order. The keys count
    // within the subscale, the published item number beside each. The three
    // dimension names are the instrument's constructs; what the participant
    // reads (the accelerator and the brakes) is the figure's business: How hot
    // is your volcano? (js/figures/volcano.js, a PROTOTYPE), which reads the
    // three as standings against the norms below.

   NOTES — the thinking so far. Nothing below this line is asked.
   ==========================================================================

   WHY A LEVEL ON THIS. Sexuality is one of the things people most want to
   know where they stand on and have least to compare themselves with, which
   makes it an engaging level. It is also data the rest of the run makes
   unusually interesting: very few samples hold sexual interests beside
   interoception, a full personality inventory, the HiTOP spectra, primal
   world beliefs and politics.

   THE DATA THERE IS. Aella's Big Kink Survey (about 970,000 people) is the
   largest survey of sexual interests there is, and a representative subsample
   of it is open: `BKSPublic.csv`, Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.18625249 (v2,
   February 2026, CC BY 4.0 / CC BY-SA 4.0), 15,503 people from the US, Canada
   and Europe, balanced on age, sex and politics, 364 columns — about 60
   interests rated 0 (not arousing) to 5 (extremely), a short OCEAN, a
   dominant-submissive self-description, partner count, porn use, upbringing,
   childhood adversity, politics. `data/norms/norms_bks.R` reads it (fetching
   it into a git-ignored folder) and prints its structure. What to know about
   the file:

     - Aella swapped demographics between similar rows and added noise before
       releasing it, shrinking correlations by about a quarter by her estimate.
     - The respondents chose to take a long survey about kinks, so "common"
       means common among them. Other samples will look more vanilla.
     - The record says the sample is capped at 32; it does not say it starts
       at 18, and the file holds 3,197 people aged 14-17. The script drops
       them; any norms taken from it must too.
     - Interests are gated: a category ("Bondage", "Power dynamics") is ticked
       first and only then are its interests rated, so a blank under an
       unticked category means "not arousing". Items sharing a gate therefore
       correlate through the gate alone, which is why the structure is worked
       out on one score a category. An item asked of everybody, as this app
       would ask it, needs no gate: somebody who would not have ticked the
       category answers 0.
     - Four ungated items (ordinary sex, cunnilingus, blowjobs, dirty talk)
       are stored on a negated -8..0 code and are read back to 0-5.

   WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS (norms_bks.R, adults, the interests a level could
   conceivably ask):

     - Three content dimensions (Velicer's MAP; a network analysis finds the
       same three clusters):
         BDSM and power      sadomasochism, bondage, power dynamics,
                             nonconsent, humiliation, toys, objects, sensory
         Fantastical         transformations, unusual bodies, mythical
                             creatures, genderplay, mind control, pregnancy
         Visual & partnered  clothing, roles, exhibitionism, multiple
                             partners, ordinary oral and anal sex. Higher in
                             men, and possibly partly just sex
     - One general factor under them, moderate (omega-h .59): a single breadth
       or "taboo" score is a fair summary, and the three still add to it.
     - One dominant-submissive axis through every category (giving against
       receiving pain, begging against being begged, "me or someone else" in
       bondage, nonconsent and humiliation: first eigenvalue 58%), and it is
       unrelated to breadth (r = .01). How much somebody wants and which side
       of it they want to be on are two axes — a plane, like Where You Stand.
     - Gentleness (caretaking, tenderness) loads on nothing; it is its own thing.
     - People do not come in kinds: a mixture model keeps improving to eight or
       nine and assigns people with a mean certainty of .70, so the kinds are
       slices of one cloud. Read back as dimensions, not types.

   A SHORT FORM (norms_bks.R, section 8): ten items asked of everybody, 0-5,
   recover each dimension well. Sadomasochism, medium bondage, humiliation
   (BDSM and power, three summed r = .87); transformations, unusual bodies,
   mythical creatures (fantastical, .89); clothing, blowjobs, roles (visual &
   partnered, .81); and mental alteration, which with the other nine gives the
   general factor (R² .85). The role axis is the hard one: the self-description
   alone correlates .55 with it, and being dominant and being submissive add
   little. Pairs asked of everybody (giving and receiving pain; "me or someone
   else?" after bondage) are the likely fix, and the survey asked them only
   inside a ticked category, so its data cannot say. The figures are somewhat
   flattering, an item being part of the category its factor was fitted to.
   Items worded as the BKS words them take its norms, which would make this the
   third level whose norms are not invented.

   THE DIMENSIONS BEING CONSIDERED for what the level reads back (September
   2026). Six (Liking was asked, and is parked):

     Libido              How much sexual wanting there is, against a quiet or
                         low libido; "Libido" for the psychoanalytic flavour.
                         NOW ASKED AS AROUSABILITY, the SIS/SES-SF's
                         Excitation, with its two brakes beside it (DESIRE,
                         below) — how readily somebody is turned on rather
                         than how much they want, which is the SDI-2's
                         (Spector et al., 1996; partnered and solitary), the
                         alternative if wanting is ever wanted too. The
                         low end is NOT "asexual": asexuality is little or
                         no attraction to other people, an orientation, which
                         the orientation item's "Nobody, or hardly anybody"
                         already records, and asexual people can have a
                         libido. The SOI-R's Desire is desire for people one is
                         not committed to, which is sociosexuality and not
                         libido
     Liking and Disgust  PARKED, as `liking` under SHELVED. How sexual things feel, warm or
                         aversive: erotophilia-erotophobia (Fisher et al.'s
                         Sexual Opinion Survey, 1988), measured as the TDDS
                         measured sexual disgust, cue by cue, on a scale
                         opened out into appeal
     Vanilla and Taboo   How far interests reach from the ordinary to the
                         forbidden, shamed or extreme: the BKS's general
                         factor. "Vanilla" rather than "Conformity", which is
                         a construct of its own in social psychology and a
                         judgement besides. Worded as the BKS words them, the
                         fantasy half can take its norms; and the BKS says how
                         rare each interest is, so a score weighted towards
                         the rare ones is nearer "taboo" than a plain mean,
                         which is breadth. The engine averages and cannot
                         weight, so that belongs to the analysis or the
                         figure. The shelved scenarios were written for it
     Fantasy and         Not one axis but the relation between two amounts: a
     Behaviour           vivid fantasy life acted on and none at all both sit
                         in the middle of a difference, and difference scores
                         are unreliable besides. NOW THE GRID'S TWO AXES,
                         asked of every kink in one press and read back as
                         the count of turn-ons lived out, never subtracted
     Role                Dominant and submissive, as TWO scores (enjoying being
                         in control, enjoying giving it up), since on one line
                         a switch and somebody indifferent both land in the
                         middle. NOW THE SIDED ITEMS: the giving items' turn-ons
                         and the receiving items', two counts, read by nothing
                         on screen yet
     Function            Why somebody has sex: closeness, pleasure, coping,
                         approval. NEXT AFTER DESIRE, with frequency; see
                         MOTIVES, below, for the two instruments and which

   All six at once would be 35-40 items, the longest level after the
   HiTOP-BR's. The SIS/SES-SF was first set aside here as "largely Libido and
   Disgust measured again", and that was half wrong: Excitation is close to
   libido, but neither brake is disgust (DESIRE, below). Also
   possible: the SOI-R's Behaviour facet (left out as three more counts beside
   the two lifetime ones) and the README's "last sexual activity", which
   FREQUENCY, below, would take the place of. Already in
   the run and free to set against the level: the Lover on the archetype wheel,
   and `SelfPlacement_Attractiveness`, which the BKS asks too.

   THE ORDER THINGS ARE COMING IN (September 2026): relationship status and
   desire now; frequency and motives after, in either order; Liking stays
   parked; satisfaction, if ever, analysis-only. Each is below.

   RELATIONSHIP. Asked since September 2026 (`Sex_Relationship`), and asked
   nowhere else in the run: without it, a "Never / not yet" in the kinks, a
   quiet accelerator and (when it comes) a low frequency cannot be told from
   an absence of anybody to have sex with. Status only. Still to decide:
     - STRUCTURE, a second item: monogamous, open, polyamorous, still
       working it out. Wanted beside the kinks especially (a threesome and
       watching a partner with someone else read differently in an open
       relationship), and kept out of the status item because "in more than
       one relationship" there would cross two questions.
     - HOW LONG, a third, asked of anybody in a relationship: desire and
       frequency both fall with its length, which is one of the best-known
       findings there is, and without it the fall reads as age.
     - WHERE IT BELONGS. It is useful to the whole run (mood, health,
       loneliness in the climb's Solitude), and `demographics3` is where it
       would go; it is here because the `default` battery's demographics are
       the group's shared set, which the ethics application says (A3), and a
       move there is an amendment and a line in docs/build_slides.py's ROWS.

   DESIRE: THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES (September 2026). Asked as the
   SIS/SES-SF (`sisses`, above), for five reasons, in the order they matter:
     - It separates DRIVE FROM BREADTH, which the kinks cannot. Kinkiness
       counts what turns somebody on, and somebody with a strong accelerator
       has more of the list turn them on for that reason alone; with
       Excitation beside it, the analysis can ask whether kinkiness is a
       taste or a temperature. The first thing to look at in the data.
     - It is a PLANE and not a line: a strong accelerator with strong brakes
       and a weak one with none are different people with the same net
       arousal, which is the model's whole point and the kind of figure the
       run does well (the temperament, Where You Stand).
     - The brakes are not disgust. Performance (SIS1) is losing arousal to
       distraction and to the fear of losing it; Consequences (SIS2) is
       harm-avoidance, being seen, caught or infected. Expected: SIS1 with
       Emotional Intensity and the PHQ-4, SIS2 with low Impulsivity and the
       Order end of Where You Stand, Excitation with Impulsivity and with the
       kinks, and — for this study the most distinctive — Excitation and
       SIS1 with the MINT. There is a small literature on interoception and
       sexual arousal (women's awareness of genital arousal, concordance);
       nobody has the SIS/SES beside a multidimensional interoception measure.
     - It is KNOWN. Nagoski's Come As You Are (2015) put "accelerator and
       brakes" in front of a very large readership, so the reading arrives
       already meaningful to many people, and it is not a verdict: neither
       end of either pedal is the good one.
     - It is SHORT, validated in both sexes and many countries, and has
       published norms by sex (Carpenter et al., 2010, now written in, pooled;
       Velten et al., 2018, a German population sample of 2,700, gives the
       whole sample's sums, in a direction it does not state, and is not
       used). That makes this the third level whose norms are not invented,
       though they are young American students' and not a population's.
   Still to do, before it is read back:
     - WHOSE CROWD. The norms are pooled over the sexes; women score lower
       on Excitation and higher on both brakes, so a woman read against the
       pool lands lower on the accelerator than against women. Whether the
       figure reads by sex is a decision for it (it should not have to: the
       plane says more than a standing against either crowd), and the
       by-sex figures are beside the norms.
     - THE FIGURE, a PROTOTYPE (September 2026): How hot is your volcano?
       (js/figures/volcano.js), the level's first section, before the
       kinks. An island volcano at dusk in cross-section, ABOVE the water
       rather than under it, for clarity (lava reads against a sky; the sea
       at its foot keeps the descent), its size and shape FIXED for
       everybody, the cleft at its crest included, and one channel doing
       one thing: Excitation the colour of the magma, Performance the width
       of the conduit, Consequences how far lava spills down the flanks —
       never an explosion, which would read a strong brake as pressure
       building. Each a standing against the pooled norms. Kept off the
       taste of the level on the way on and the fork cards. Weighed and
       left: bubbles or lightning beside the colour (two things a channel);
       a crust sealing the cleft; watchers round the vent for the risk
       brake; heat escaping as a shimmer where no lava spills; the net of
       accelerator and brakes as the cleft's glow (a fourth thing, and no
       dimension of its own); and the car's two pedals. The rules it keeps:
       one thing a channel, and nothing that makes the quiet end look
       lesser — the cool volcano is dormant, not dead.
     - STILL TO TRY on the figure (September 2026, after the first
       pictures of it):
         SUBMERSION, a fourth channel: how much of the volcano stands
         above the sea, the volcano itself unchanged and only the sea
         level moving, the water a light tint so the whole shape still
         shows (mocked up, not built). It keeps size out of it — the shape
         never changes, only how much of it is in the air — and "above the
         surface" against "beneath it" is the one metaphor the other three
         channels do not use. What it could read: SEXUAL OPENNESS, how much
         of somebody's sex life others see or hear about (a short
         self-disclosure or sexual communication scale — Byers & Demmons,
         1999; Catania, 1986 — or a few custom items), or its reverse,
         PRIVACY; perhaps SHAME AND GUILT, as what is kept under; or, with
         no new items, the share of the kinks' turn-ons lived out (above
         the water what has been acted on, below what stays in the
         imagination). THE CAVEAT, whichever it is: a volcano mostly under
         water must never read as something to fix. Privacy is a
         preference and not a symptom, a seamount is as much a volcano as
         an island, and shame in particular is the reading most likely to
         turn a submerged volcano into a problem — the psychoanalytic
         register this level refuses (the volcano's rules, below: no
         "repressed", no "bottled up"). Whatever drives it, the lava wants
         to stop where the water starts (or carry on under it as pillow
         lava), or a high sea shortens the spill and two channels tangle.
         A STALL IN THE CONDUIT, for the distraction brake: instead of the
         channel narrowing, the magma rising only part of the way up it,
         held by a plug of cooled rock, so that a strong brake leaves it
         stopped about halfway and a light one lets it reach the cleft.
         Still one thing (how high it gets rather than how wide), and
         nearer the construct than width: arousal lost to distraction is
         arousal that stops on the way. The care it wants: the chamber
         must still glow, so a stalled volcano is held and not cold, and
         the words stay "held", never "blocked". It would also leave the
         cleft without magma in it, which then says the same as the risk
         brake's spill, so the two would want telling apart.
         THE SPILL was the weakest channel as first drawn, tracing the lips
         of the cleft like the outline lit up. Redrawn (September 2026) as
         a tongue of lava on each flank, thick at the lip and tapering to a
         round toe, the range spent on the flank rather than the lip, and
         steaming where it reaches the sea.
     - WORDS. "Brakes" must not read as a fault: a brake on arousal when
       somebody might walk in is working, not broken. "Held" and "kept",
       never "blocked" (the volcano's rule, below). The participant reads
       Heat, Focus and Caution (September 2026; Accelerator and two Brakes
       before), each worded to sit well at either end and none of them
       reversed, since the brakes are systems of their own and a reversed
       name (Daring) would make the cautious end the lesser one; the file
       says Excitation and Inhibition.
     - LICENCE. The chapter carries no copyright notice or terms of use,
       and the Handbook prints its measures for research; the SIS/SES is
       also distributed by the Kinsey Institute. Worth a line to the
       authors (Janssen) before `default` asks it.
     - ATTENTION CHECK. The level has none; `SISSES_AttentionCheck`, asking
       for "Strongly disagree" (off the agreeing end the Consequences items
       pull to), would be the natural one if the level wants one.

   FREQUENCY, after desire. Three or four items worded as Natsal-3 asked
   them (the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles,
   2010-12, about 15,000 people in Britain aged 16-74; data on the UK Data
   Service), for REAL, REPRESENTATIVE BRITISH NORMS — the one place on this
   level the app could have them:
     - partnered sex in the last four weeks (occasions)
     - masturbation in the last four weeks
     - whether somebody would like sex more often, less often or about as
       often as now, which gives the gentlest reading on the level (wanting
       more or less than one has is common either way and says nothing is
       wrong) and the discrepancy the SIS/SES cannot give. Check Natsal-3's
       own wording and whether it asks this; Natsal-2 did something like it.
     - perhaps "how often do you think about sex", the question everybody
       has heard a myth about, if there is a norm to read it against.
   Read against RELATIONSHIP (above), or it is uninterpretable. NOT DURATION:
   how long sex lasts assumes it is penetrative and ends when a man does,
   is estimated badly by everybody, and is the item likeliest to make
   somebody feel measured against a standard. Frequency is Article 9 data
   like the rest, and no more identifying than the partner counts.

   MOTIVES, after desire: why somebody has sex. Two instruments:
     - Cooper, Shapiro & Powers (1998), six motives: intimacy, enhancement
       (pleasure), self-affirmation, coping, partner approval, peer approval.
       Twenty-nine items; two a motive, adapted as the control questionnaire
       on Mind & Heart is, would be twelve. PREFERRED, because COPING — sex to
       manage a bad feeling — sits beside the CERQ on Mind & Heart and the
       HiTOP-BR's spectra, and self-affirmation beside the self-esteem single
       on level 1, and because approach and avoidance motives are what the
       relationship literature (Impett, Gable) predicts outcomes from.
     - The BSAS's Communion and Instrumentality (Hendrick et al., 2006; five
       items each, two scales that can both be high), shorter and
       overlapping the SOI-R's Attitude, which is nearly an Instrumentality
       item. The fallback if twelve items is too many.
   Worth doing for one reason beyond the science: it is THE ONE READING ON
   THIS LEVEL SOMEBODY COULD SHARE COMFORTABLY. Why somebody has sex says
   much less about them than what they are into, so it is a partial answer
   to THE BLOCKERS, 4 — a level whose share button carries the motives and
   never the kinks. A wheel or a compass of six, read against each other
   (the archetypes' rule), would need no norms at all.

   LIKING, STILL PARKED, and now for a second reason: much of it is covered
   twice. The grid's "It disgusts me" column is a disgust count across the
   kinks, and its "It's not for me" column an aversion count, and the accelerator is the approach side of ordinary cues. What
   Liking would still add is the disgust end of ordinary sex and its link
   to the Order end of Where You Stand, which is an analysis question
   rather than a reading. Comes back only if the pilot shows the two
   proxies do not do its job.

   SATISFACTION, if ever, ANALYSIS-ONLY (`results: false`). The GMSEX
   (Lawrance & Byers, 1995: five bipolar adjectives, good-bad,
   pleasant-unpleasant… — each a slider) or the NSSS-S (Štulhofer et al.,
   2010, twelve items). It goes with everything in the run and would be
   worth having, but read back it is a verdict — "less satisfied than 80% of
   people" — which is exactly what the climb is drawn to avoid. And asked
   only of somebody with a sex life to be satisfied with, which is a
   `showIf` on RELATIONSHIP or the partner counts.

   THE LIKING CUES, what was tried and taken out (September 2026):

     - "Hearing two strangers having sex", the TDDS's sexual item 1, reads as
       annoyance at the noise, and a bed at 2 a.m. is where most people put
       the scene, rather than as disgust at the sex.
     - "Walking in on two people having sex", which replaced it, is
       voyeurism — a kink in its own right (below), not a reaction to sex as
       such — and the awkwardness of intruding, which nearly everybody feels.
     - "The sounds people make during sex" can be heard as porn; it is asked
       as a partner's.
     - "Sex when neither of you has showered" was written as the one cue at
       the disgust end for most people, but a lapse in hygiene is pathogen
       disgust, the TDDS's other domain, as much as sexual. The body cue that
       replaced it keeps the smell and taste, which are part of ordinary sex,
       and drops the lapse; some pathogen disgust will still reach it, as it
       reaches the TDDS's own "Performing oral sex".
     - The Sexual Opinion Survey's own items were considered and left: they
       are statements about erotica rather than reactions to it, dated, and
       several (group sex, "unusual sex practices", worry about being
       homosexual) would measure Taboo or orientation instead.

   VOYEURISM AND EXHIBITIONISM, a kink to explore. Watching others and being
   watched came up twice: "Walking in on two people having sex" was taken out
   of the Liking cues for being voyeurism rather than a reaction to sex, and
   the shelved scenarios ask "Being watched while having sex" (the BKS's
   Exhibitionism: me). The BKS has both sides, gated inside one category, and
   finds them in its visual & partnered cluster. Asked of everybody as a pair —
   watching, being watched — they could be a small Role-like axis of their own,
   or two more scenarios. Worth keeping to: the people watched are
   consenting, so that watching cannot read as intrusion.

   TRIED AND SHELVED, commented out under SHELVED rather than deleted, since
   each was worked out with care and any may come back:

     - `liking`, Sexual Liking: ten ordinary cues on one scale from "Very
       disgusting" to "Very appealing" (`SEX_VALENCE`), asked until September
       2026 and parked for a pair of axes with more pull to them (IMAGINATION
       AND ACTIVITY, below). Sound, and the likeliest to come back as a third
       thing read off the level;

     - the TDDS's seven sexual-disgust items (Tybur et al., 2009), on a scale
       opened out from "Very arousing" to "Very disgusting" (-3 to 3), the two
       items naming "the opposite sex" worded from the orientation instead —
       the form `liking` now takes, with cues of its own;
     - the SOI-R's Attitude and Desire (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008), its Behaviour
       left out, both its scales cut from nine points to seven;
     - twelve scenarios from vanilla to taboo, each asked twice over, as a
       fantasy and as an experience, for Vanilla and Taboo and for Fantasy and
       Behaviour.

   The TDDS and the SOI-R are not the published instruments any more, and
   their comments say how. Neither paper is on the shelf in `literature/`,
   and the item wordings were written from memory: check them against the
   sources before either returns.

   THE KINKS: WHY, WHAT ELSE THERE IS, WHAT WAS WEIGHED AND WHY THIS
   (September 2026).

   Why. Of everything a level on sexuality could ask, what somebody is into
   is the thing people most want to know where they stand on and the thing
   least asked of them straight: sexual interests have been surveyed mostly
   as paraphilia (Joyal & Carpentier, 2017, who asked 1,040 Quebec adults
   both interest and experience and found most "anomalous" interests common)
   or as fantasy alone (Wilson's Sex Fantasy Questionnaire, 1978; Lehmiller's
   4,175 Americans, 2018), and the one large open survey of them, the BKS, is
   self-selected and asks no behaviour. A list of kinks is also the shareable
   reading — a count with a crowd behind it — and, beside the run's
   personality, interoception, world beliefs and politics, data nobody has.

   What else there is, and what they share. The BKS gates: tick a category,
   then rate its interests 0-5 for arousal, sixty-odd items. Joyal asks
   intensity of each fantasy and, in a second pass, whether it was done.
   Wilson and Lehmiller ask how often each is fantasised. Common to all:
   "does it turn you on" and "have you done it" are two instruments or two
   passes, and nothing between wanting and not wanting.

   What was weighed, in order. (1) A plane of Imagination (how many of the
   list appeal) against Activity (how often sex happens), the share acted on
   as a sentence under it — dropped once the count turned out to be the
   whole of the vanilla-to-taboo scale in the BKS (the count against the
   rarity-weighted count r = .97, four people in five in two corners of the
   plane), and because Activity cannot be read off the list at all, nobody
   doing what they do not fancy. (2) Twelve scenarios asked twice over,
   fantasy then experience, as two questionnaires: 22 screens, and nothing
   next to its own pair; SHELVED. (3) One line of six steps a kink — Not for
   me / Turns me on, in my imagination / Tried it, not for me / Done it once
   or twice / Done it many times / It's part of my sex life — one press
   saying both; asked until the grid. A line through two dimensions visits
   some of their cells: it had no place for somebody fine with a thing they
   do regularly for a partner, or for somebody who would if it came up, and
   it read "done" as "wanted". The which-side follow-up after each sided
   kink, asked only of those it turned on, lost the same people. (4) Two rows
   of buttons on one screen, appeal then experience, a Continue under them —
   the grouped items the shelved note over `SEX_SCENARIOS` describes, two
   keys and the most engine. (5) Two tick-lists, what appeals and then, of
   those, what has been done: no intensity, and two new pieces of engine.

   Why this. The grid is (3)'s one press with (4)'s two scales: three
   columns of appeal by four rows of experience, twelve cells, each a
   recognisable person and every one an honest answer. "I'm fine with it" is
   the missing row, and the inconsistent cells — turned on and never done,
   not for me and done many times — are the ones worth having, which is the
   opposite of the scenarios' worry that a pair in view is answered
   consistently. It costs the engine one renderer and one stylesheet block,
   the cells being written out as options, and the file one column an item
   with both words in it. The sided kinks are two items each, so Role comes
   out as two scores rather than one line with the switch and the indifferent
   on the same point. Read back: the count, the crowd, how many of the count
   have been lived, and never which. In the file for the analysis and nowhere on
   screen: the accommodating count (fine with it, done), done without wanting
   (not for me, many times), Role, and a skip told from a no.

   THE LIST (September 2026) is a ladder: a rung or two in every band of
   prevalence, from rough sex (~75%) to objectification (~8%), so that the
   count tells people apart at the vanilla end and in the tail and not only
   in the middle, which is where a list written for interest alone piles up.
   Dirty talk (94% of the BKS's adults) was the top rung and came off as too
   near the floor to tell anybody apart — the "none of these" band says
   vanilla well enough — and sexting (~65) took its place at the common end,
   an act with no side and little sex difference in it. Twenty-two items, fourteen kinks, eight of them
   as their two sides. Two decisions shape it. Acts and scenarios only: feet,
   outfits and crossdressing are attractions rather than things done — a
   construct of their own, and crossdressing brushes gender identity — so no
   fetish object is on it. And nothing fantastical: creatures, transformation
   and hypnosis were on it for a long tail that was not BDSM, and were taken
   out as too specific — hypnosis in particular reads as a cover for being
   controlled, which the power pair asks straight — so the tail is now the
   power-and-pain extremes and three rarer things done between people
   (orgasm control, watching a partner with someone else, objectification),
   and the count leans BDSM at its top, knowingly. Dominating and rough sex
   overlap and are both kept, on different rungs and worded apart (a
   relation; what is done to a body). The rung between 22 and 8 is thin, and
   the four estimated shares want the app's own data. Not on it, and worth
   weighing if it grows: filming yourselves, sex with somebody just met, an
   open relationship. A shared card shows the crowd and the count, never
   which kinks (THE BLOCKERS, 4); and "kinkier than 90% of people" is the
   likeliest line to travel, so whose crowd it is has to be said once the
   placeholder norm is replaced.

   THE FIGURE: A VOLCANO UNDER THE SEA, not built. A cross-section of the
   seabed at a mid-ocean ridge, where new crust is made: dark water above, the
   seabed, the crust in layers, a magma chamber under it, a pipe up through the
   crust and a dome of lava pushed out onto the seabed. It is on theme twice —
   the level is met in the water by some people and in the rock by others, and
   the descent already passes "the deepest life found in the crust" — and it is
   a real cross-section of a volcano, so the resemblance it can bear to
   genitals (the author's sketch: a dome over a pipe over a chamber) comes out
   of the geology rather than being drawn in, which is what keeps it witty and
   SFW, and shareable. Each dimension does one thing, the sea's and the climb's
   rule, and none switches at a threshold:

     Libido              the chamber, small and dull red to large and
                         white-gold; the magma's colour follows it all the way
                         up
     Liking              the crust, warm and porous to cold black basalt. With
                         the cues, a layer a cue, the pipe widening through a
                         warm one and narrowing through a cold one, so its
                         outline is the answers; hovering a layer names its
                         cue
     Taboo               rare minerals: no exotic crystal in the veins at the
                         vanilla end, a seam of gems at the other
     Fantasy and         where the magma ends up, which is real geology: magma
     Behaviour           cooling underground makes intrusive rock, sheets and
                         bodies branching inside the crust, and magma erupting
                         makes lava on the seabed. A rich fantasy life is a
                         crust full of frozen branches, acting on it is lava
                         outside; both can be large, both small, or either
     Role, Function      two spectra under the figure, as Where You Stand has
                         under its plane, each drawn as its two scores

   With the SOI-R's Desire and Attitude as the two channels, the four corners
   were lava coming out slowly (hot and open: effusive, as on Hawaii, never an
   explosion), heat glowing through the seams of sealed rock (hot and sealed),
   hot springs and shimmer (cool and open) and quiet cold ground (cool and
   sealed) — none of them named on the figure.

   What to watch in it:

     - WHICH READING is not the answers' business. Tying the shape to gender or
       to the masculine-feminine slider confuses expression with anatomy, and
       tying the opening to anything makes "open" feminine and "pushing out"
       masculine. One shape for everybody that reads either way (a crater or a
       cleft in the dome, which domes often have), or two views: the side, and
       the view from above, where a ridge is a long cleft between raised lips,
       that one being the badge.
     - THE PREVIEW is shown before the level is answered, on a fork card and
       in the teaser under "Next", and a blurred suggestive shape is more
       suggestive than a sharp one; it may also change who takes the level and
       how its items are answered. Keep this figure off both and show the
       level's name alone there.
     - THE QUIET END: people high on disgust or low on libido get a small, cold,
       sealed scene, and are the likeliest to take the joke as at their
       expense. It must look calm and whole, not lesser; the two ends drawn
       small under it ("Other people carry other fires") show the range as
       landscape.
     - NO PSYCHOANALYSIS IN THE WORDS: "pressure", "repressed" and "bottled up"
       make a sealed crust a problem to be fixed. "Held" and "kept", never
       "blocked". Libido is a name, not a theory.
     - VENT LIFE (tube worms, crabs) where the heat reaches the water would be
       beautiful and would make more desire look like more life: either none,
       or life of its own at every setting (vents where it is hot, cold seeps
       where it is not).
     - EVERY BAR A REACH along its own scale, never a standing against other
       people.
     - FOR THE COMMITTEE it is a cross-section of a volcano whose shape follows
       the answers, and the double meaning is left out of anything written.

   Earlier ideas, still possible: a map of desire (the BKS categories laid out
   in two dimensions from their correlations, rare ones at the edge, the
   person's lit), or the plane of breadth against dominant-submissive.

   SHELVED — written whole and commented out, to start simple (see TRIED AND
   SHELVED, above). The helpers come first; the questionnaires after them are
   entries of the `defineBlock("sex", [...])` list above, and come back by
   moving them into it (after `sexuality`) with their helpers out of the
   comment. Nothing live refers to any of them. `SEX_RATHER_NOT`, which the

   ==========================================================================

// Erotophilia-erotophobia (Fisher et al., 1988), measured as the affect each
// of ten ordinary sexual cues meets with, on one scale from disgust to
// appeal. NOT the Sexual Opinion Survey's items, which are dated statements
// about erotica; the cue-and-reaction form is the TDDS's (Tybur et al.,
// 2009), whose pornography item is kept verbatim and whose oral-sex item is
// adapted, and whose scale is opened out below its floor, as the shelved
// version was (see SHELVED). Every cue is ordinary, partnered or solitary
// sex, and none names a sex, so it reads the same whatever the orientation.
// Cues are chosen to spread: some most people meet warmly, some split, some
// most people recoil from, so the scale has room at both ends. High is
// liking; nothing reverses. The cues tried and taken out, and why, are under
// NOTES.
//
// "Very appealing" rather than "Very arousing" at the top, which the shelved
// TDDS and the BKS have, for four reasons:
//
//   - The construct. Erotophilia is how positive or negative the feeling a
//     sexual cue meets with is (Fisher et al., 1988), and arousal is only one
//     positive feeling: warmth, ease and fondness count too.
//   - The plane. Arousal carries libido, which Desire already measures across:
//     an erotophilic person with a quiet libido would land near "neither" on
//     every cue and read as more erotophobic than they are, and the two axes
//     would go together because of how the scale is worded.
//   - One line. Appeal and disgust are two ends of approach and avoidance;
//     arousal and disgust are partly separate systems, arousal damping disgust
//     (Borg & de Jong, 2012), so a cue can be both — the ardent and wary
//     corner the figure is most for — and a line between them leaves that
//     person no true answer.
//   - The cues. Some are pleasant or off-putting without being arousing (a
//     friend's sex life, told); asked up to arousal they would lose their top
//     half.
//
// What it costs: "appealing" can be answered as an opinion ("fine in
// principle") rather than as a feeling, which the instruction — how the idea
// makes you feel — only partly heads off, and the precedent of the TDDS and
// the BKS, though neither's norms carry over to a bipolar scale anyway. If the
// pilot shows opinion creeping in, the fix is not "arousing" but two unipolar
// ratings a cue, arousal and disgust asked apart: twice the items, and the cue
// that is both becomes an answer rather than a gap.
//
// Oral sex is also one of the shelved scenarios, asked there on a unipolar
// scale of arousal for reach; here the question is whether it meets warmth
// or recoil, and the gap between giving and receiving is the most
// disgust-specific thing on the scale — shown at analysis, not scored, a
// difference of two single items being as unreliable as a score gets.

    // TDDS, sexual domain ===================================================
    // The seven sexual items of the Three Domain Disgust Scale (Tybur,
    // Lieberman & Griskevicius, 2009, Journal of Personality and Social
    // Psychology, 97, 103-122), whose other fourteen are pathogen and moral
    // disgust. Sexual disgust in its account is what steers somebody away
    // from partners and acts that would cost them as a mate. It is expected
    // to go against the SOI-R below and with the Order end of Where You
    // Stand, the best-known link between disgust and politics.
    //
    // **Adapted, not verbatim**, in two ways.
    //
    // The scale is opened out at its bottom. The TDDS asks how disgusting
    // each thing is, from 0 "not at all disgusting" to 6 "extremely
    // disgusting", so everything that is not disgusting is one point, and
    // somebody who finds a thing arousing and somebody who finds it merely
    // unremarkable give the same answer. Here the scale runs from "Very
    // arousing" to "Very disgusting", seven circles saved as -3 to 3, the
    // middle being neither and the two ends worded alike, so that neither
    // reads as the stronger. High is still disgust, as in the TDDS, but the published
    // 0 falls somewhere between -3 and 0 on this one, so neither the scores
    // nor the norms are the TDDS's, and none is pooled with TDDS data.
    //
    // Two items say "the opposite sex", which asks a gay man about a woman's
    // hand on his thigh — not what the item is about, which is a potential
    // partner taking a liberty. Those two are worded from
    // `Sex_Orientation` instead (`attractedTo`): about women for the
    // three answers leaning towards women, about men for the three leaning
    // towards men, and about nobody in particular for "equally", "nobody"
    // and "rather not say". The wording shown is not saved; it is read back
    // off the orientation. The other five name nobody's sex and are asked as
    // published, without their full stops.

    // SOI-R, Attitude and Desire ============================================
    // The Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008,
    // Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, 1113-1135): how
    // willing somebody is to have sex outside a committed relationship, as
    // three facets of three items. **Two of the three are asked.** Behaviour
    // (partners in the last year, partners had once, partners had without
    // wanting anything longer) is left out: it is three more counts beside
    // the two lifetime counts above, and the most identifying thing on the
    // level. Without it there is no SOI-R total, only the two facets, which
    // are the two the paper finds most distinct in what they predict and
    // which carry the largest differences between the sexes.
    //
    // The items are verbatim but for the full stops; **the scales are not**.
    // The SOI-R's are nine points, one a facet, which is why each item
    // carries its own format; here both are seven, the TDDS's length, so the
    // level is answered on one number of points throughout. Attitude keeps
    // its two ends on seven circles. Desire keeps seven of its nine
    // frequencies, dropping "about once every two or three months" and
    // "about once every two weeks", the two that fall between neighbours
    // close enough to stand in for them; `SOIR_OFTEN` says which published
    // step each is. So neither facet's scores or norms are the SOI-R's, and
    // none is pooled with SOI-R data; rescaled, the published norms are a
    // rough guide at best.
    //
    // **Held in the published order** (`shuffle: false`): shuffled, the two
    // formats would come in no order, and the inventory was validated asked
    // in its own. The keys count within the facet; Penke's item numbers are
    // beside each run. Expected to go with low Honesty-Humility and with
